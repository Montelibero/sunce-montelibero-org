<h1>Privacy Policy for MTL Sunce Wallet</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy outlines the approach to privacy and data handling for users of MTL Sunce Wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet application for the Stellar blockchain. Given the nature of the Stellar blockchain and the functionality of MTL Sunce Wallet, this policy clarifies our stance on data collection, usage, and security.</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>MTL Sunce Wallet does not collect personal information from its users. The application enables users to independently publish transactions on the Stellar blockchain, which is inherently public. Users should understand that all transactions made through the blockchain are accessible to third parties without any involvement from MTL Sunce Wallet.</p>

<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<p>As MTL Sunce Wallet does not collect or transmit any additional information to developers, there is no use of user data beyond what is inherently conducted on the Stellar blockchain.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
<p>Given the lack of data collection, developers cannot and do not disclose any user information to third parties. The visibility of transactions and account details on the blockchain is governed by the blockchain's own public nature, not by MTL Sunce Wallet's policies.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Efforts are made within reasonable bounds to ensure the security of the MTL Sunce Wallet application against both malicious attacks and inadvertent user actions. However, no guarantees are provided regarding the complete security of user data, given the complexities of cybersecurity and the public nature of the Stellar blockchain.</p>

<h2>Access to and Control Over Information</h2>
<p>Users have access to and control over their information as permitted by Stellar blockchain technology. It is important for users to recognize that information published to the blockchain is permanent and cannot typically be removed or deleted. Within MTL Sunce Wallet, users can freely add, modify, and delete managed Stellar accounts, but this does not affect the blockchain's permanent record.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>MTL Sunce Wallet does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies, as it is a standalone application without web-based tracking functionalities.</p>

<h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Users are required to review and accept the updated version of this Privacy Policy upon application updates. Continued use of MTL Sunce Wallet after an update signifies acceptance of the revised privacy terms.</p>

<hr>

<p>This Privacy Policy provides a transparent overview of MTL Sunce Wallet's data practices, emphasizing the application's non-involvement in data collection beyond blockchain activities and underscoring the public nature of blockchain transactions. Users are encouraged to remain informed about the specifics of Stellar blockchain operations to better understand the privacy implications of their transactions.</p>
